# Simple-HR-Analytics-Dashboard

##  Objective
The objective of this is to find reasons why employees quit.

## Step 1: Data Preparation (Cleaning)

    #### "First, I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. It had 1,470 employee records. I checked the data for errors and converted the data range into an Excel Table using Ctrl + T. This made it easier to analyze."

## Step 2: Data Analysis (Pivot Tables)

#### Next, I used Pivot Tables to answer three main questions:

#### 1. Which department has the highest attrition?
#### 2.Does low income lead to resignation?
#### 3.Does job satisfaction affect employee retention?"

## Step 3: Visualization (Dashboard)

#### Then, I created a Dynamic Dashboard.
#### I used Bar Charts and Column Charts to visualize the numbers.
#### I added Slicers for 'Gender' and 'Education' so we can filter the data easily."

## Step 4: Key Findings (Insights)

#### From my analysis, I found that:

#### The R&D Department has the highest number of people leaving.
#### Employees with lower salaries (around $4,700) are more likely to leave compared to high earners.

## Step 5: Recommendations

 #### Based on this, I recommend that the HR team should review the salary packages for R&D roles to reduce staff turnover.
